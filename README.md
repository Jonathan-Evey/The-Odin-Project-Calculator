HTML / CSS / JavaScript

Assignment

1. Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators.
        add
        subtract
        multiply
        divide

2. Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

3. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.

4. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.

5. Make the calculator work!
    
<!---Still need to add decimal button function--->
EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)

EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This is a great project to practice your CSS skills. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.

EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
